CamXploit is a reconnaissance tool designed to help researchers and security enthusiasts check if an IP address is hosting an exposed CCTV camera. It scans common camera ports, checks for login pages, tests default credentials, and provides useful search links for further investigation.  

⚠️ **Disclaimer:** This tool is intended for educational and security research purposes **only**. Unauthorized scanning of systems you do not own is illegal. Use responsibly.
