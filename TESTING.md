# Testing Plan

This document outlines the testing plan for the HelloBird application. The goal of this testing plan is to ensure that the application is working as expected and that it is free of any major bugs or security vulnerabilities.

## 1. Core Functionality Testing

This section outlines the tests for the core functionality of the application.

### 1.1. Scanning

-   **Test Case 1.1.1:** Scan a single valid IP address.
    -   **Expected Result:** The application should scan the IP address and display the results in the output container.
-   **Test Case 1.1.2:** Scan a valid CIDR range.
    -   **Expected Result:** The application should scan all the IP addresses in the CIDR range and display the results in the output container. The output for each IP address should be prefixed with the IP address.
-   **Test Case 1.1.3:** Scan an invalid IP address.
    -   **Expected Result:** The application should display an error message and should not attempt to scan the IP address.
-   **Test Case 1.1.4:** Scan an invalid CIDR range.
    -   **Expected Result:** The application should display an error message and should not attempt to scan the CIDR range.

### 1.2. Stream Viewing

-   **Test Case 1.2.1:** View a valid video stream.
    -   **Expected Result:** The application should open the video stream in the video player and the stream should play smoothly.
-   **Test Case 1.2.2:** View an invalid video stream.
    -   **Expected Result:** The application should display an error message and should not attempt to open the video stream.

### 1.3. AI-Powered Contextual Analysis

-   **Test Case 1.3.1:** Scan an IP address with a known open camera.
    -   **Expected Result:** The application should display a contextual summary of the video stream, including the likely environment, key objects identified, and a one-sentence summary.

## 2. Security Testing

This section outlines the tests for the security of the application.

### 2.1. Input Validation

-   **Test Case 2.1.1:** Enter a malicious string in the IP address input field.
    -   **Expected Result:** The application should properly sanitize the input and should not be vulnerable to command injection or other security vulnerabilities.

### 2.2. API Endpoints

-   **Test Case 2.2.1:** Send a malicious request to the `/scan` endpoint.
    -   **Expected Result:** The application should properly handle the request and should not be vulnerable to any security vulnerabilities.
-   **Test Case 2.2.2:** Send a malicious request to the `/stream` endpoint.
    -   **Expected Result:** The application should properly handle the request and should not be vulnerable to any security vulnerabilities.

## 3. Usability Testing

This section outlines the tests for the usability of the application.

### 3.1. User Interface

-   **Test Case 3.1.1:** Use the application on a variety of devices and screen sizes.
    -   **Expected Result:** The application should be responsive and should be easy to use on all devices.

### 3.2. User Experience

-   **Test Case 3.2.1:** Perform a complete scan and stream viewing workflow.
    -   **Expected Result:** The workflow should be intuitive and easy to follow.
